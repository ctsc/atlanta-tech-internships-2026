# Contributing to Summer 2026 Tech Internships

Thanks for helping make this resource better for everyone! This repo is automatically maintained by AI, but we rely on the community to catch listings we miss.

## Submitting a New Internship Listing

The easiest way to contribute is through our structured issue form:

1. Go to [Submit a New Internship](https://github.com/ctsc/atlanta-tech-internships-2026/issues/new?template=new-internship.yml)
2. Fill out the required fields:
   - **Company Name** — The company offering the internship
   - **Role Title** — The exact title of the position
   - **Application URL** — A direct link to the application page
   - **Location(s)** — Where the internship is located (e.g., "Atlanta, GA / Remote")
   - **Role Category** — Software Engineering, ML/AI, Data Science, Quant, PM, or Hardware
3. Optionally check any applicable flags (sponsorship, citizenship, remote, advanced degree)
4. Submit the issue

## What Happens After You Submit

Your submission goes through our automated validation pipeline:

1. **Parsing** — The bot reads the structured fields from your issue
2. **AI Validation** — Gemini AI verifies that the listing is a real Summer 2026 tech internship
3. **Link Check** — The application URL is verified to be live and accessible
4. **Deduplication** — The system checks whether the listing already exists in our database

If everything checks out, the listing is added to the repo and your issue is closed with a confirmation comment. If there's a problem (dead link, duplicate, not a valid internship), the bot will explain why and close the issue.

## Update Cycle

The repo updates automatically **every 6 hours**. Community submissions are processed when they are opened or labeled. Your listing will appear in the README after the next pipeline run.

## What We're Looking For

We track **Summer 2026 tech internships** in these categories:

- Software Engineering (SWE, frontend, backend, full stack, mobile, DevOps)
- Machine Learning / AI / Data Science
- Quantitative Finance
- Product Management
- Hardware Engineering (embedded, firmware, FPGA, chip design)

We have a heavy focus on internships in **Georgia** (Atlanta, Alpharetta, and statewide), but we track listings across all locations.

## What We Don't Track

- Full-time positions (internships and co-ops only)
- Non-tech roles (marketing, sales, HR, etc.)
- Listings from known body shops (Revature, Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Cognizant)

## Questions?

Open a regular issue (not the internship template) if you have questions, suggestions, or bug reports.

Thank you for contributing!
